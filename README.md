# B5W0: Solar Data Discovery

## Project Overview
This project analyzes solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The goal is to clean, explore, and extract insights from the solar energy datasets to better understand solar power generation trends and patterns in these regions.

## Data Sources
- Solar farm datasets (CSV files) provided as part of the 10 Academy Week 0 challenge.
- The datasets include solar generation metrics collected over time from the three countries.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key features.
- Visualize solar power generation patterns by country and time.
- Document findings and methodology in the final project report.

## Project Structure
